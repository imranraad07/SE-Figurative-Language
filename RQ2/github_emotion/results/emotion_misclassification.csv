899508459,"Sorry for my long response time. Here is my suggestion for the API modifications:
I would add a new field to NgUpdate:
`potentialUpdateAvailalbe: Observable<PotentialUpdateAvailableEvent>` .
This should meet the `a new version has been detected to exist (but is not available to use yet)` and `a new version starts downloading` event. At least for me it looks there is no need to differentiate as downloading starts immediately after the potential update was detected.
Same is for `a new version finishes downloading` which is basically the same as `a new version is available to be activated`.
**Regarding [USER] comment:**
I guess sticking to Promises is fine here as Observables would require a call to `.subscribe()`. But I can agree on adding a meaningful return value. I would prefer a signature like this:
`checkForUpdate(): Promise<UpdateAvailableEvent | NoUpdateAvailableEvent | UpdateFailedEvent>`. Throwing an error in case of failure would force applications to catch it which would be definitely a breaking change.
And for `activateUpdate` it could look like this: `activateUpdate(): Promise<UpdateActivatedEvent | ActivationFailedEvent>`.
TBH I am not sure if returning the events is the best way here. If an error is thrown in case of failure, returning a `boolean` value would be possible as well.

954259800,"Apologies, I should have been more specific with my comment. What I meant to say is that Flutter plugins (and even pure Dart packages) using FFI are in need of being able to detect a hot-restart as much as plugin's using platform channels.
Given this is a development-time only issue, I would be happy with as simple a mechanism as possible. The effect I'm trying to fix is that I'm making use of a native library (eg. C, Rust, etc) which holds one or more resources (eg. sockets, bluetooth, audio etc) which need to be released on stop. On Linux desktop as an example, this happens if the hosting OS process is destroyed during debugging when the Flutter app is stopped, but does not happen during a hot-restart. I have to be honest and admit I don't know the details of what happens during a Dart hot-restart, but it seems to be that the running Isolate(s?) is killed and then started again? Any how, the effect is that Dart side references to the native library are lost, while the native library continues to run, potentially on its own thread(s).
To fix the above, I would request having some sort of lifecycle sync callback that can be registered by an app to be called prior to hot-restart taking place. This would allow me as the app author the chance to call any required `close()/destroy()/stop()`, etc on native libraries (or for that matter platform channel plugins) that I'm using to have them cleanup their resource usage. This then doesn't impact or require changes from existing native libraries as they would be expected to already be providing some sort of cleanup resources API and platform channel plugins do not need to be aware of this API, its just something a plugin user knows to make use of in order I know this can potentially block hot-restart but as the app author I will have had to explicitly regsiter for this callback and then do something to block that callback completing so thats on me as the app author, plus I've already experienced existing bugs that cause hot-restarts to stall so its not something that would block dev work, but it would at least give app authors that are making use of such native libraries and platform channel plugins the effective use of hot-restart again.
Ideally I would expect this being done upstream in Dart because hot-restart is a Dart mechanism and there is an already [an issue for it](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/42679) but I understand that pure Dart usage is a niche usage compared to Flutter so I would be happy just for a Flutter specific implementation.",Fear,Joy,,Fear,Sadness,,TRUE,,Sadness,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE

898477405,"[USER] great point! Thank you. You are right that the testing components today rely on JIT. Usually not because they are dynamic but because you need the flexibility to declare them inline, usually within functions of a test file as your example shows.
With the right compiler and API modifications we should be able to support this with AOT (thanks to Ivy). This change could be rolled out with an automated migration so nobody has to rewrite their tests.
But as you bring up, this flexibility of testing components means that you could dynamically create a template or modify the component metadata (e.g. use string concat and interpolation to create a unique template for a bunch of components created within a loop that wraps an `it` or `describe`.
This is not the most common pattern but I'd be shocked if some codebases didn't rely on it. I currently don't have a solution for this one. Maybe the composition api could be it, but automated migration from unconstrained TS/JS code that generates a component to a component built using the composition API would be tricky and not 100% reliable.
